Multiple projects building headless WordPress + Astro themes. WordPress acts as a headless CMS using WPGraphQL to access the data, and Astro acts purely as a configurable frontend site.

Contributed to:
- mapping of posts, pages, and redirects to Astro
- mapping of tags, categories and author pages to Astro
- theme configuration
- SEO mapping (through the Yoast plugin)
- creating an automatic deployment process using webhooks and GitHub Actions for any deployment platform
