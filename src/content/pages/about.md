Hi there, I'm a web developer based in Wellington, New Zealand. - After studying to be a network engineer and working in IT support related roles, I decided to become a developer in 2023. - I've always been interested in computers and tech. - From an early age, I've loved computers - from setting up emulators to play old games, installing and configuring different OSs, building my own PCs, and dabbling in software and game development. - In my spare time, I like to read (slowly), run on local tracks, go to the cinema, and play the piano (poorly). - I also watch too much basketball.
