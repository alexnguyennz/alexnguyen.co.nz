        Hi there, I'm a freelance web developer based in New Zealand. After
        initially wanting to be a network engineer and working in IT support
        type roles for a few years, I decided to become a developer in 2023.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm currently taking on new projects, and I'm interested in developer
        roles (local or remote). Feel free to <a
          href="mailto:me@alexnguyen.co.nz"
          class="animated-link">contact me âœ‰</a
        > about any opportunities or projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my spare time, I like to read (slowly), run on local tracks, go to
        the cinema, and play the piano (poorly). I also watch too much
        basketball.
