Hi there, I'm a web developer from New Zealand. After studying to be a
network engineer and working in IT support related roles, I decided to
become a developer in 2023.

In my spare time, I like to read (slowly), run on local tracks, watch
movies and shows, and play the piano (poorly). I also watch too much
basketball.
