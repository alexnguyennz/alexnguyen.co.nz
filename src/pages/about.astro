            Hi I'm a web developer living in Wellington, New Zealand. After
            working in IT support related roles for a few years, in 2023 I
            decided to switch paths and become a developer. I'm freelancing and
            am currently interested in any full-time roles so feel free to reach
            out about any opportunities.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my spare time, I like to run on local tracks, go to the cinema
            and poorly play the piano, and help out at local charities.
          </p>
