    <p>
      Hi there, I'm a web developer based in Wellington, New Zealand. After
      studying to be a network engineer and working in IT support related roles,
      I decided to become a freelance developer in 2023.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've always been interested in computers and tech. From an early age I
      loved using computers - from setting up emulators to play old games,
      installing and configuring different operating systems, building my own
      PCs, and dabbling in software and game development.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my spare time, I like to read (slowly), run on local tracks, go to the
      cinema, and play the piano (poorly). I'm currently writing a comedy
      fiction book. I also watch too much basketball.
