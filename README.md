Version 3 of my personal site (v1 built with Next.js, v2 built with Deno Fresh). Don't really know what I'm doing with it so I just mess around with the design every now and then.

This site uses Astro and Tailwind CSS and is hosted on Netlify.

### Main Tools

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - web framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - hosting
