It has a great developer experience, features, community, and\nit’s frequently updated.\n\nThese are some findings or quirks I’ve noted when using it that don’t warrant a\nseparate blog post, things that you may encounter depending on the Astro version\nyou’re using. These may be things I’ve missed in the documentation, something\nI’ve done incorrectly (likely), or an actual issue or bug (less likely).\n\n\nUPGRADING TO ASTRO 4.0\n\n\nASTRO-ICON WITH LOCAL IMAGES\n\nUpdate to astro-icon@0.8.2 ↗\n[https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon/releases/tag/astro-icon%400.8.2] to be\nable to use local icons in an Astro 4.0 project.\n\n\nVIEW TRANSITIONS\n\n\nCLIENT:ONLY PRIORITY\n\nclient:only is meant to have a high priority and behaves like client:load\n(except server rendering is skipped), but any component using client:only won’t\nimmediately show its static content (without hydration) resulting in a flash\n(unlike client:load). This doesn’t seem to change if your page is server\nrendered or static.\n\n\nSELECTORS WITH PAGE EVENTS\n\nWhen selecting elements, make sure to call them inside the called function of\nthe event listener, otherwise the reference will be stale when you get to the\nnext page:\n\n*.astro\n<script is:inline>\n  // this won't work after you navigate\n  // const menu = document.getElementById(\"menu\");\n\n\n  function initMenu() {\n    const menu = document.getElementById(\"menu\");\n    // ...\n  }\n\n\n  initMenu();\n\n\n  document.addEventListener(\"astro:after-swap\", () => initMenu());\n</script>\n\n\n\n\nDEFINE:VARS WITH LIFECYCLE EVENTS\n\nIf you use define:vars ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#definevars] to pass\nfrontmatter variables into your script tag, everything inside will re-run\neverytime that variable changes:\n\n*.astro\n---\nconst pathname = new URL(Astro.request.url).pathname;\n---\n\n\n<script define:vars={{ pathname }}>\n  // this will log for every pathname change, not just once on initial site load\n  document.addEventListener(\"astro:page-load\", () => console.log(\"page-load\"), {\n    once: true,\n  });\n</script>\n\n\n\n\nISSUES WITH CSS ANIMATIONS\n\nThere is a visual issue I’ve encountered with Firefox when using\n<ViewTransitions /> with the default fallback ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#fallback-control] (for\nbrowsers that don’t support the View Transitions API yet) and a CSS opacity\nanimation on page load.\n\nThe opacity was set to 0 and set to animate to 100% with a CSS animation but\nusing View Transitions resulted in the animation never running (or the opacity\nnot being set).\n\nThe workaround was to use a fallback of swap:\n\nLayout.astro\n<head>\n  <ViewTransitions fallback=\"swap\" />\n  <!-- ... -->\n</head>\n\n\n\nThis is something I’ll look to investigate in the future.\n\n\nCOLLECTIONS\n\n\nQUERYING ALL COLLECTIONS\n\nThere is no built-in way to query all collections. One workaround to do this is\nusing Astro.glob ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#astroglob] to pull all\nmarkdown files:\n\n*.astro\n---\nconst collections = await Astro.glob(\"../content/**/*.md\");\n---\n\n\n\nThe data returned from this will be different from the data returned from\ngetCollection ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#getcollection]. If you\nneeded it in the same structure, you could extract the folder names only using\nthe data from Astro.glob, and then loop over them with getCollection.\n\n\nIMAGES\n\n\nREMOTE IMAGES WITH SUBDOMAINS\n\nYou need to specify the subdomain for any remote image ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#remote-images] links in\nastro.config.mjs, otherwise it won’t get optimized and the original source will\nbe used:\n\n*.astro\n<!-- resolves to https://fastly.picsum.photos/** -->\n<Image\n  src=\"https://picsum.photos/200/300\"\n  width=\"500\"\n  height=\"500\"\n  alt=\"remote image\"\n/>\n\n\nastro.config.mjs\nexport default defineConfig({\n  image: {\n    domains: [\"fastly.picsum.photos\"],\n    // or if you need a wildcard\n    remotePatterns: [{\n      protocol: 'https',\n      hostname: '**.picsum.photos'\n    }]\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nCONTENT COLLECTIONS\n\nWhen referencing images in content collections ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#images-in-content-collections] using\nthe image helper, you can also reference the image from the root directory\n(src).\n\nmy-post.md\n---\nimage: ./my-post.jpg # default\nimage: /src/content/posts/my-post.jpg\n---\n\n\n\nYou may need to do this for compatibility with your CMS, for example, if it\ndoesn’t support reading relative paths for things like image previews.\n\n\nFRAMEWORK COMPONENTS / ISLANDS\n\n\nMIXING FRAMEWORKS\n\nWhen using components from multiple frameworks together, not adding the\nextension may result in an error of This component likely uses @astrojs/react\n...:\n\nimport { Gallery } from \"./Gallery\";\n\n\n\nChange this to:\n\nimport { Gallery } from \"./Gallery\"; // React\nimport { Gallery } from \"./Gallery.vue\"; // Vue\nimport { Gallery } from \"./Gallery.svelte\"; // Svelte\n\n\n\nAlternatively (although I’m not sure why you would do this), you can force the\ncomponent to hydrate for a particular framework with client:only ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientonly] to make\nit work without the extension.\n\n\nSVELTE WITHOUT CLIENT DIRECTIVE\n\nYou must use a client directive ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives]\nfor a Svelte component’s slot to appear, even if this component doesn’t need to\nhydrate.\n\n*.astro\n<Button client:load>Button Text</Button>\n\n\nButton.svelte\n<button>\n  <slot />\n</button>\n\n\n\nThe same behaviour also happens with named slots ↗\n[https://svelte.dev/docs/special-elements#slot-slot-name-name].\n\n*.astro\n<Button>\n  <Fragment slot=\"text\">Button Text</Fragment>\n</Button>\n\n\nButton.svelte\n<button>\n  <slot name=\"text\" />\n</button>\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to do this with React or Vue.\n\n\nTYPESCRIPT\n\n\nPROPS WITH CLIENT DIRECTIVES\n\nYou may get various type errors when using client directives ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives]\nwith any props other than children (not sure if this applies to other non-React\nframeworks):\n\n*.astro\n<Fade client:visible delay={0.25}><h1>Title</h1></Fade>\n\n\n\nWhich results in:\n\nType '{ children: any; \"client:visible\": true; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & { delay: number; children: ReactNode; }.\nProperty 'delay' is missing in type '{ children: any; \"client:visible\": true; }' but required in type '{ delay: number; children: ReactNode; }'\n\n\n\nA (bad) workaround is to mark these prop(s) as optional in your type or\ninterface inside that component:\n\nFade.tsx\nexport function Fade({\n  delay,\n  children,\n}: {\n  delay?: number;\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {}\n\n\n\nThere is likely a better solution as this hides the error even if the prop(s)\nisn’t optional.\n\n\nWEBSTORM\n\nThere are some issues resolving types with WebStorm with an active issue here ↗\n[https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-59503].\n\nOne solution which solves a lot of the problems is using the bundled TypeScript\nsetting. Open Settings > Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > TypeScript >\nBundled.\n\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\n\nIMPORTING THE ASTRO CONFIG\n\nIf you want to import your config from astro.config.mjs elsewhere in your\nproject, it will only work in development.\n\nAll of these methods will fail during build:\n\n*.astro\nimport config from \"../../astro.config.mjs\";\nconsole.log(\"Astro config\", config);\n\n\n*.astro\nconst config = await Astro.glob(\"../../astro.config.mjs\");\nconsole.log(\"Astro config\", config[0].default);\n\n\n*.astro\nconst config = import.meta.glob(\"../../astro.config.mjs\");\n\n\nfor (const path in config) {\n  config[path]().then((mod) => {\n    console.log(mod.default);\n  });\n}\n\n\n\nThis is due to the use of any Astro imports like @astrojs/react which I guess\ncan’t be properly parsed or serialized during build.\n\nOne workaround is to create a separate config file that doesn’t use any Astro\nrelated imports which you import in astro.config.mjs and anywhere else:\n\nsrc/config.ts\nexport default {\n  site: \"example.com\",\n  server: {\n    port: 3000,\n  },\n  // ...\n};\n\n\nastro.config.mjs\nimport config from \"/src/config.ts\";\nimport react from \"@astrojs/react\";\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  ...config,\n  integrations: [\n    react(),\n  ],\n  // ...\n});\n\n\n*.astro\nimport config from \"../config.ts\";\nconsole.log(\"config\", config);\n\n\n\nWith this method you won’t be able to read the functions you set, but if you\nwanted to, you could set additional values in the config object (config.ts)\nwhich you import in astro.config.mjs, and manually add the functions to the\nrelevant key like integrations, based on which ones exist.\n\n\nSYNTAX OR REHYPE PLUGINS\n\nTo use a plugin like Rehype Pretty Code ↗\n[https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/], you will need to disable the default\nAstro syntax highlighting in your astro.config.mjs:\n\nastro.config.mjs\nmarkdown: {\n  syntaxHighlight: false\n}\n\n\n\nAstro’s highlighting runs last, so it has priority over any existing plugins."},"2":{"path":"/blog/astro-dark-mode-view-transitions/","title":"Astro dark mode and View Transitions - Alex Nguyen - Web Developer","h1":"ASTRO DARK MODE AND VIEW TRANSITIONS","content":"ASTRO DARK MODE AND VIEW TRANSITIONS\n\nThis tutorial will cover how to implement a theme toggle feature in your Astro\nsite (3.0+ or 4.0+) that works with View Transitions ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/].\n\nDark mode will be toggled based on a dark class that is added to the <html>\nelement.\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\nMARKUP\n\nFirst, we’ll add our markup and icons we need for our dark mode toggle.\n\nCreate a ThemeToggle.astro somewhere, like in your /src/components folder, and\nadd:\n\nThemeToggle.astro\n<button\n  type=\"button\"\n  id=\"themeToggle\"\n  aria-label=\"toggle theme\"\n  class=\"relative rounded-full p-1.5 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-100\"\n>\n  <span class=\"sr-only\">toggle theme</span>\n  <Icon\n    pack=\"lucide\"\n    name=\"sun\"\n    class=\"absolute -left-1/2 -top-1/2 h-6 w-6 rotate-0 scale-100 transition duration-200 dark:-rotate-90 dark:scale-0\"\n  />\n  <Icon\n    pack=\"lucide\"\n    name=\"moon\"\n    class=\"absolute -left-1/2 -top-1/2 h-6 w-6 rotate-90 scale-0 transition duration-200 dark:rotate-0 dark:scale-100\"\n  />\n</button>\n\n\n\n\nSCRIPT\n\nAt the bottom of the ThemeToggle.astro component, add an inline script:\n\n<script is:inline>\n\n\n</script>\n\n\n\nIt’s important to set the reference to our button element within the script\nwe’re calling (and not outside it for example), otherwise the reference will be\nthe stale by the next page. Remember that View Transitions won’t re-initialize\nany scripts unless you specifically set it to. This means\n\n\nPAGE ANIMATIONS\n\nWe can run some other effects in combination with View Transitions when the\ntheme is toggled.\n\nFor example, check out Akash Hamirwasia ↗\n[https://akashhamirwasia.com/blog/full-page-theme-toggle-animation-with-view-transitions-api/]’s\ntutorial on creating a full page transition. We can do the same in Astro with\nslightly different code:\n\nconst handleToggleClick = async () => {\n// don't await for non-supported browsers so the toggle still works\nif (document.startViewTransition)\n  await document.startViewTransition().ready;\n}\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND COLOURS\n\nBy default, the animation will use the same background colour as your html’s\nelement. This means the animation might look as if it’s disappearing during the\neffect because it may blend in with the rest of your page depending on any other\nelements which “break” it up.\n\nIn this case, you may want to use a different background colour for the\nanimation, so it looks distinct compared to the page. This colour could be a\nslightly different shade for a subtler difference.\n\nOne way to do this is to use a fallback background colour - this colour will be\nused for the transition:\n\n/* white is the colour for the transition while the default background colour is set to rgb(240, 249, 255) */\nhtml {\n  background: white\n    linear-gradient(\n      0deg,\n      rgba(240, 249, 255, 1) 0%,\n      rgba(240, 249, 255, 1) 100%\n    );\n}\n\n\n/* same as above with these specific colours */\nhtml.dark {\n  background: black\n    linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(5, 8, 47, 1) 0%, rgba(21, 94, 117, 1) 100%);\n}\n\n"},"3":{"path":"/blog/astro-loading-spinners/","title":"Astro loading spinners - Alex Nguyen - Web Developer","h1":"ASTRO LOADING SPINNERS","content":"ASTRO LOADING SPINNERS\n\nIf you use a framework component with a client directive ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientonly] of\nclient:only, you may see a flash of no content until the component renders.\n\nIn this case, it may be useful to show a loading state like a spinner or\nskeleton until the component loads - especially if it will take longer than a\nsecond.\n\nOne way to do this is to use a separate loading element alongside your framework\ncomponent, and hide or remove that element once the component mounts.\n\n\nREACT EXAMPLE\n\n*.astro\n{/* some sort of indicator or spinner */}\n<svg\n  class=\"spinner\"\n  ...\n  >\n</svg>\n<ReactComponent client:only=\"react\" />\n\n\nReactComponent.tsx\nimport { useEffect } from \"react\";\n\n\nexport function ReactComponent() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const spinner = document.querySelector(\".spinner\");\n    if (spinner) spinner.remove();\n  }, []);\n\n\n  return <div>React content</div>;\n}\n\n\n\n\nVUE EXAMPLE\n\n*.astro\n<VueComponent client:only=\"vue\" />\n\n\nVueComponent.vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\n  import { onMounted } from \"vue\";\n\n\n  onMounted(() => {\n    const spinner = document.querySelector(\".spinner\");\n    if (spinner) spinner.remove();\n  });\n</script>\n\n\n<template>\n  <div>Vue content</div>\n</template>\n\n\n\n\nSVELTE EXAMPLE\n\n*.astro\n<SvelteComponent client:only=\"svelte\" />\n\n\nSvelteComponent.svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import { onMount } from 'svelte';\n\n\n  onMount(() => {\n    const spinner = document.querySelector(\".spinner\");\n    if (spinner) spinner.remove();\n  });\n</script>\n\n\n<div>Svelte content</div>\n\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE\n\nIf you’re using another directive like client:load or client:visible, your\ncomponent’s initial view (before it hydrates) may render right away.\n\nIn this case, you probably don’t need to do anything.

A\ndirect benefit is potentially improved page performance by only loading scripts\nwhen they’re actually needed.\n\n\nUSE CASE\n\nIt’s common to have two navigation menus - one for mobile and one for desktop.\nIf the mobile navigation is toggleable, client:visible can be used, so it\nhydrates at a low priority.\n\nHowever, if the desktop navigation has dropdown menus that don’t need to hydrate\nat all even when visible, then that component could use hover or mouseover based\nclient directive instead, so it only hydrates based on a user action.\n\nFor example, I used this at vsctrust.org.nz ↗ [https://vsctrust.org.nz]. Using\nclient:visible in a local production build:\n\nclient:visible critical requests chain\n[/_astro/client-visible.t2pajXkW_JADgC.webp]\n\nUsing client:mouseover:\n\nclient:mouseover critical requests chain\n[/_astro/client-mouseover.7JeU6A-m_1Cr6CL.webp]\n\nDid it improve the performance to a level where I could perceive it? No, but it\nwas a fun exercise, and maybe doing something like this would make a real\ndifference on a heavier page, especially on older devices.\n\n\nCREATING A CUSTOM CLIENT DIRECTIVE\n\nWe’ll look at creating a custom hover or mouseover client directive.\n\nSomewhere in your Astro project, (like a lib folder or similar), create a folder\ncalled client-directives. In this folder, create a mouseover.js (or mouseover.ts\nif you prefer TypeScript) file and add:\n\nmouseover.js\n/**\n * @type {import('astro').ClientDirective}\n */\nexport default (load, opts, element) => {\n  element.addEventListener(\n    \"mouseover\",\n    async () => {\n      const hydrate = await load();\n      await hydrate();\n    },\n    { once: true }, // remove the event listener\n  );\n};\n\n\nmouseover.ts\nimport type { ClientDirective } from \"astro\";\n\n\nexport default (function (load, _opts, element) {\n  element.addEventListener(\n    \"mouseover\",\n    async () => {\n      const hydrate = await load();\n      await hydrate();\n    },\n  { once: true },\n);\n} satisfies ClientDirective);\n\n\n\nThis will hydrate the component once the mouseover event is triggered on the\nelement.\n\nThen add this directive as an Astro integration.

There’s no simple way to do this, like with Next.js’s\nImage priority feature ↗\n[https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#priority].\n\nBut you can use Astro’s getImage ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#generating-images-with-getimage]\nfunction to generate an optimized image server-side (or during the build for\nstatic sites), and use this image’s path in the preload’s href and on the page\n(as an <img> or picture>) instead.\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nIn this example, we’ll preload an image from our /src/assets folder called\nproject.png.\n\nStart by importing the getImage function and the image in an Astro page or\ncomponent:\n\n*.astro\n---\nimport { getImage } from \"astro:assets\";\n\n\nimport image from \"../assets/project.png\".\nconst optimizedImage = await getImage({\n  src: image,\n  format: \"webp\",\n  width: 500, // resize optional\n  height: 500, // resize optional\n});\n---\n\n\n\nTo use this optimized image, you can still use the <Image /> component:\n\n<Image\n  src={optimizedImage.options.src}\n  width={optimizedImage.attributes.width}\n  height={optimizedImage.attributes.height}\n  alt=\"\"\n/>\n\n\n\nYou can also use a normal <img> tag:\n\n<img\n  src={optimizedImage.src}\n  width={optimizedImage.attributes.width}\n  height={optimizedImage.attributes.height}\n  alt=\"\"\n/>\n\n\n\nFinally, add a preload with the image to your page’s head element:\n\n*.astro\n<head>\n  <link rel=\"preload\" href={optimizedImage.src} as=\"image\" />\n</head>\n\n\n\nIf you’re using a layout with an existing <head>, then you can use named slots ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#named-slots] to\npass in the link tag from another page or component without creating duplicate\n<head> tags:\n\nLayout.astro\n<head>\n  {/* ... */}\n\n\n  <slot name=\"head\" />\n</head>\n\n\n*.astro\n<Fragment slot=\"head\">\n  <link rel=\"preload\" href={optimizedImage.src} as=\"image\" />\n</Fragment>\n\n\n\n\nCONTENT COLLECTIONS\n\nIf you’re using content collections, and you’re including images in the\ncollection schema ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#images-in-content-collections], then\nyou can reference this image directly:\n\n[slug].astro\n---\nimport { getImage } from \"astro:assets\";\n\n\n/* export async function getStaticPaths() { ... }, etc. */\n\n\nconst { project } = Astro.props;\nconst optimizedImage = await getImage({ src: project.data.image });\n---\n\n\n\n\nBRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER\n\nTo check that the preloading worked correctly, you can build your site and run\nit locally - change the commands as needed based on your package manager.\n\nFor static sites, run npm run build and then npm run preview.\n\nFor hybrid or server sites, you should be able to use the Node.js adapter ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/] (even if you’re\nusing another adapter like for Vercel or Netlify, just swap them out for\ntesting). Run npm run build and then npm run preview.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be a simple built-in way of checking preloaded resources.\nBut if you open your browser’s network tab and filter for images, the preloaded\nimage should be at or near the top of all requests:\n\nbrowser network tab showing image resources\n[/_astro/browser-network-tab.pSumB9v3_1d2Kh5.webp]\n\nYou can also remove the filter to see how it compares with all other request\ntypes, or re-build with the preload removed to see how it changes.\n\nMake sure to also check the page source - the paths in the <link> tag and <img>\ntag should match:\n\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/_astro/project.xCZHVmaS_29nlmI.webp\" as=\"image\">\n\n\n<img src=\"/_astro/project.xCZHVmaS_29nlmI.webp\" />\n\n\n\nAlso, if you’re using Chrome or Edge, you’ll get a warning in your console after\na few seconds if it didn’t work - The resource *.webp was preloaded using link\npreload but not used within a few seconds .... Other browsers may do something\nsimilar.\n\n\nVIEW TRANSITIONS\n\nIf you’re using View Transitions ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/] and animations between\nimages, preloading should also help prevent the image flickering as it’s loaded\nfor the first time as you navigate to the new page.\n\nFor example, if you have a product carousel with small images linking to product\npages with a larger resolution of the same image, you may want to preload these\nlarger images.\n\nOtherwise, it can look jarring when the image loads during the element’s\ntransition to the next page. Preloading the image should help with this.\nAlternatively, you could use the same image between pages if you’re willing to\nsacrifice flexibility with the optimizations e.g. width and height.\n\nKeep in mind that preloading isn’t a guarantee for improving things, and may\nactually make your page performance worse. But the example in this post is a\nreasonable solution if you feel the need to use preloading or other optimization\ntechniques."},"6":{"path":"/blog/third-party-authentication-with-surrealdb/","title":"Third-party authentication with SurrealDB - Alex Nguyen - Web Developer","h1":"THIRD-PARTY AUTHENTICATION WITH SURREALDB","content":"THIRD-PARTY AUTHENTICATION WITH SURREALDB\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis tutorial will cover how to authenticate using a third-party provider with\nSurrealDB ↗ [https://surrealdb.com/].

This doesn’t seem to change if your page is server\nrendered or static.\n\n\nSELECTORS WITH PAGE EVENTS\n\nWhen selecting elements, make sure to call them inside the called function of\nthe event listener, otherwise the reference will be stale when you get to the\nnext page:\n\n*.astro\n<script is:inline>\n  // this won't work after you navigate\n  // const menu = document.getElementById(\"menu\");\n\n\n  function initMenu() {\n    const menu = document.getElementById(\"menu\");\n    // ...\n  }\n\n\n  initMenu();\n\n\n  document.addEventListener(\"astro:after-swap\", () => initMenu());\n</script>\n\n\n\n\nDEFINE:VARS WITH LIFECYCLE EVENTS\n\nIf you use define:vars ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#definevars] to pass\nfrontmatter variables into your script tag, everything inside will re-run\neverytime that variable changes:\n\n*.astro\n---\nconst pathname = new URL(Astro.request.url).pathname;\n---\n\n\n<script define:vars={{ pathname }}>\n  // this will log for every pathname change, not just once on initial site load\n  document.addEventListener(\"astro:page-load\", () => console.log(\"page-load\"), {\n    once: true,\n  });\n</script>\n\n\n\n\nISSUES WITH CSS ANIMATIONS\n\nThere is a visual issue I’ve encountered with Firefox when using\n<ViewTransitions /> with the default fallback ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#fallback-control] (for\nbrowsers that don’t support the View Transitions API yet) and a CSS opacity\nanimation on page load.\n\nThe opacity was set to 0 and set to animate to 100% with a CSS animation but\nusing View Transitions resulted in the animation never running (or the opacity\nnot being set).\n\nThe workaround was to use a fallback of swap:\n\nLayout.astro\n<head>\n  <ViewTransitions fallback=\"swap\" />\n  <!-- ... -->\n</head>\n\n\n\nThis is something I’ll look to investigate in the future.\n\n\nCOLLECTIONS\n\n\nQUERYING ALL COLLECTIONS\n\nThere is no built-in way to query all collections. One workaround to do this is\nusing Astro.glob ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#astroglob] to pull all\nmarkdown files:\n\n*.astro\n---\nconst collections = await Astro.glob(\"../content/**/*.md\");\n---\n\n\n\nThe data returned from this will be different from the data returned from\ngetCollection ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#getcollection]. If you\nneeded it in the same structure, you could extract the folder names only using\nthe data from Astro.glob, and then loop over them with getCollection.\n\n\nIMAGES\n\n\nREMOTE IMAGES WITH SUBDOMAINS\n\nYou need to specify the subdomain for any remote image ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#remote-images] links in\nastro.config.mjs, otherwise it won’t get optimized and the original source will\nbe used:\n\n*.astro\n<!-- resolves to https://fastly.picsum.photos/** -->\n<Image\n  src=\"https://picsum.photos/200/300\"\n  width=\"500\"\n  height=\"500\"\n  alt=\"remote image\"\n/>\n\n\nastro.config.mjs\nexport default defineConfig({\n  image: {\n    domains: [\"fastly.picsum.photos\"],\n    // or if you need a wildcard\n    remotePatterns: [{\n      protocol: 'https',\n      hostname: '**.picsum.photos'\n    }]\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nCONTENT COLLECTIONS\n\nWhen referencing images in content collections ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#images-in-content-collections] using\nthe image helper, you can also reference the image from the root directory\n(src).\n\nmy-post.md\n---\nimage: ./my-post.jpg # default\nimage: /src/content/posts/my-post.jpg\n---\n\n\n\nYou may need to do this for compatibility with your CMS, for example, if it\ndoesn’t support reading relative paths for things like image previews.\n\n\nFRAMEWORK COMPONENTS / ISLANDS\n\n\nMIXING FRAMEWORKS\n\nWhen using components from multiple frameworks together, not adding the\nextension may result in an error of This component likely uses @astrojs/react\n...:\n\nimport { Gallery } from \"./Gallery\";\n\n\n\nChange this to:\n\nimport { Gallery } from \"./Gallery\"; // React\nimport { Gallery } from \"./Gallery.vue\"; // Vue\nimport { Gallery } from \"./Gallery.svelte\"; // Svelte\n\n\n\nAlternatively (although I’m not sure why you would do this), you can force the\ncomponent to hydrate for a particular framework with client:only ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientonly] to make\nit work without the extension.\n\n\nSVELTE WITHOUT CLIENT DIRECTIVE\n\nYou must use a client directive ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives]\nfor a Svelte component’s slot to appear, even if this component doesn’t need to\nhydrate.\n\n*.astro\n<Button client:load>Button Text</Button>\n\n\nButton.svelte\n<button>\n  <slot />\n</button>\n\n\n\nThe same behaviour also happens with named slots ↗\n[https://svelte.dev/docs/special-elements#slot-slot-name-name].\n\n*.astro\n<Button>\n  <Fragment slot=\"text\">Button Text</Fragment>\n</Button>\n\n\nButton.svelte\n<button>\n  <slot name=\"text\" />\n</button>\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to do this with React or Vue.\n\n\nTYPESCRIPT\n\n\nPROPS WITH CLIENT DIRECTIVES\n\nYou may get various type errors when using client directives ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives]\nwith any props other than children (not sure if this applies to other non-React\nframeworks):\n\n*.astro\n<Fade client:visible delay={0.25}><h1>Title</h1></Fade>\n\n\n\nWhich results in:\n\nType '{ children: any; \"client:visible\": true; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & { delay: number; children: ReactNode; }.\nProperty 'delay' is missing in type '{ children: any; \"client:visible\": true; }' but required in type '{ delay: number; children: ReactNode; }'\n\n\n\nA (bad) workaround is to mark these prop(s) as optional in your type or\ninterface inside that component:\n\nFade.tsx\nexport function Fade({\n  delay,\n  children,\n}: {\n  delay?: number;\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {}\n\n\n\nThere is likely a better solution as this hides the error even if the prop(s)\nisn’t optional.\n\n\nWEBSTORM\n\nThere are some issues resolving types with WebStorm with an active issue here ↗\n[https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-59503].\n\nOne solution which solves a lot of the problems is using the bundled TypeScript\nsetting. Open Settings > Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > TypeScript >\nBundled.\n\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\n\nIMPORTING THE ASTRO CONFIG\n\nIf you want to import your config from astro.config.mjs elsewhere in your\nproject, it will only work in development.\n\nAll of these methods will fail during build:\n\n*.astro\nimport config from \"../../astro.config.mjs\";\nconsole.log(\"Astro config\", config);\n\n\n*.astro\nconst config = await Astro.glob(\"../../astro.config.mjs\");\nconsole.log(\"Astro config\", config[0].default);\n\n\n*.astro\nconst config = import.meta.glob(\"../../astro.config.mjs\");\n\n\nfor (const path in config) {\n  config[path]().then((mod) => {\n    console.log(mod.default);\n  });\n}\n\n\n\nThis is due to the use of any Astro imports like @astrojs/react which I guess\ncan’t be properly parsed or serialized during build.\n\nOne workaround is to create a separate config file that doesn’t use any Astro\nrelated imports which you import in astro.config.mjs and anywhere else:\n\nsrc/config.ts\nexport default {\n  site: \"example.com\",\n  server: {\n    port: 3000,\n  },\n  // ...\n};\n\n\nastro.config.mjs\nimport config from \"/src/config.ts\";\nimport react from \"@astrojs/react\";\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  ...config,\n  integrations: [\n    react(),\n  ],\n  // ...\n});\n\n\n*.astro\nimport config from \"../config.ts\";\nconsole.log(\"config\", config);\n\n\n\nWith this method you won’t be able to read the functions you set, but if you\nwanted to, you could set additional values in the config object (config.ts)\nwhich you import in astro.config.mjs, and manually add the functions to the\nrelevant key like integrations, based on which ones exist.\n\n\nSYNTAX OR REHYPE PLUGINS\n\nTo use a plugin like Rehype Pretty Code ↗\n[https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/], you will need to disable the default\nAstro syntax highlighting in your astro.config.mjs:\n\nastro.config.mjs\nmarkdown: {\n  syntaxHighlight: false\n}\n\n\n\nAstro’s highlighting runs last, so it has priority over any existing plugins."],[2,"ASTRO DARK MODE AND VIEW TRANSITIONS\n\nThis tutorial will cover how to implement a theme toggle feature in your Astro\nsite (3.0+ or 4.0+) that works with View Transitions ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/].\n\nDark mode will be toggled based on a dark class that is added to the <html>\nelement.\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\nMARKUP\n\nFirst, we’ll add our markup and icons we need for our dark mode toggle.\n\nCreate a ThemeToggle.astro somewhere, like in your /src/components folder, and\nadd:\n\nThemeToggle.astro\n<button\n  type=\"button\"\n  id=\"themeToggle\"\n  aria-label=\"toggle theme\"\n  class=\"relative rounded-full p-1.5 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-100\"\n>\n  <span class=\"sr-only\">toggle theme</span>\n  <Icon\n    pack=\"lucide\"\n    name=\"sun\"\n    class=\"absolute -left-1/2 -top-1/2 h-6 w-6 rotate-0 scale-100 transition duration-200 dark:-rotate-90 dark:scale-0\"\n  />\n  <Icon\n    pack=\"lucide\"\n    name=\"moon\"\n    class=\"absolute -left-1/2 -top-1/2 h-6 w-6 rotate-90 scale-0 transition duration-200 dark:rotate-0 dark:scale-100\"\n  />\n</button>\n\n\n\n\nSCRIPT\n\nAt the bottom of the ThemeToggle.astro component, add an inline script:\n\n<script is:inline>\n\n\n</script>\n\n\n\nIt’s important to set the reference to our button element within the script\nwe’re calling (and not outside it for example), otherwise the reference will be\nthe stale by the next page. Remember that View Transitions won’t re-initialize\nany scripts unless you specifically set it to. This means\n\n\nPAGE ANIMATIONS\n\nWe can run some other effects in combination with View Transitions when the\ntheme is toggled.\n\nFor example, check out Akash Hamirwasia ↗\n[https://akashhamirwasia.com/blog/full-page-theme-toggle-animation-with-view-transitions-api/]’s\ntutorial on creating a full page transition. We can do the same in Astro with\nslightly different code:\n\nconst handleToggleClick = async () => {\n// don't await for non-supported browsers so the toggle still works\nif (document.startViewTransition)\n  await document.startViewTransition().ready;\n}\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND COLOURS\n\nBy default, the animation will use the same background colour as your html’s\nelement. This means the animation might look as if it’s disappearing during the\neffect because it may blend in with the rest of your page depending on any other\nelements which “break” it up.\n\nIn this case, you may want to use a different background colour for the\nanimation, so it looks distinct compared to the page. This colour could be a\nslightly different shade for a subtler difference.\n\nOne way to do this is to use a fallback background colour - this colour will be\nused for the transition:\n\n/* white is the colour for the transition while the default background colour is set to rgb(240, 249, 255) */\nhtml {\n  background: white\n    linear-gradient(\n      0deg,\n      rgba(240, 249, 255, 1) 0%,\n      rgba(240, 249, 255, 1) 100%\n    );\n}\n\n\n/* same as above with these specific colours */\nhtml.dark {\n  background: black\n    linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(5, 8, 47, 1) 0%, rgba(21, 94, 117, 1) 100%);\n}\n\n"],[3,"ASTRO LOADING SPINNERS\n\nIf you use a framework component with a client directive ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientonly] of\nclient:only, you may see a flash of no content until the component renders.\n\nIn this case, it may be useful to show a loading state like a spinner or\nskeleton until the component loads - especially if it will take longer than a\nsecond.\n\nOne way to do this is to use a separate loading element alongside your framework\ncomponent, and hide or remove that element once the component mounts.\n\n\nREACT EXAMPLE\n\n*.astro\n{/* some sort of indicator or spinner */}\n<svg\n  class=\"spinner\"\n  ...\n  >\n</svg>\n<ReactComponent client:only=\"react\" />\n\n\nReactComponent.tsx\nimport { useEffect } from \"react\";\n\n\nexport function ReactComponent() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const spinner = document.querySelector(\".spinner\");\n    if (spinner) spinner.remove();\n  }, []);\n\n\n  return <div>React content</div>;\n}\n\n\n\n\nVUE EXAMPLE\n\n*.astro\n<VueComponent client:only=\"vue\" />\n\n\nVueComponent.vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\n  import { onMounted } from \"vue\";\n\n\n  onMounted(() => {\n    const spinner = document.querySelector(\".spinner\");\n    if (spinner) spinner.remove();\n  });\n</script>\n\n\n<template>\n  <div>Vue content</div>\n</template>\n\n\n\n\nSVELTE EXAMPLE\n\n*.astro\n<SvelteComponent client:only=\"svelte\" />\n\n\nSvelteComponent.svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import { onMount } from 'svelte';\n\n\n  onMount(() => {\n    const spinner = document.querySelector(\".spinner\");\n    if (spinner) spinner.remove();\n  });\n</script>\n\n\n<div>Svelte content</div>\n\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE\n\nIf you’re using another directive like client:load or client:visible, your\ncomponent’s initial view (before it hydrates) may render right away.\n\nIn this case, you probably don’t need to do anything. But if you still need to\nshow a loading state, then you can handle this within the component itself. For\nexample, you could add a loading spinner within the component, and then\nconditionally render the final view once it’s ready (with state)."],[4,"CUSTOM CLIENT DIRECTIVES WITH ASTRO\n\nCustom client directives ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#custom-client-directives]\nare useful when you want more control over when framework components or islands\n↗ [https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/] hydrate in an Astro site. A\ndirect benefit is potentially improved page performance by only loading scripts\nwhen they’re actually needed.\n\n\nUSE CASE\n\nIt’s common to have two navigation menus - one for mobile and one for desktop.\nIf the mobile navigation is toggleable, client:visible can be used, so it\nhydrates at a low priority.\n\nHowever, if the desktop navigation has dropdown menus that don’t need to hydrate\nat all even when visible, then that component could use hover or mouseover based\nclient directive instead, so it only hydrates based on a user action.\n\nFor example, I used this at vsctrust.org.nz ↗ [https://vsctrust.org.nz]. Using\nclient:visible in a local production build:\n\nclient:visible critical requests chain\n[/_astro/client-visible.t2pajXkW_JADgC.webp]\n\nUsing client:mouseover:\n\nclient:mouseover critical requests chain\n[/_astro/client-mouseover.7JeU6A-m_1Cr6CL.webp]\n\nDid it improve the performance to a level where I could perceive it? No, but it\nwas a fun exercise, and maybe doing something like this would make a real\ndifference on a heavier page, especially on older devices.\n\n\nCREATING A CUSTOM CLIENT DIRECTIVE\n\nWe’ll look at creating a custom hover or mouseover client directive.\n\nSomewhere in your Astro project, (like a lib folder or similar), create a folder\ncalled client-directives. In this folder, create a mouseover.js (or mouseover.ts\nif you prefer TypeScript) file and add:\n\nmouseover.js\n/**\n * @type {import('astro').ClientDirective}\n */\nexport default (load, opts, element) => {\n  element.addEventListener(\n    \"mouseover\",\n    async () => {\n      const hydrate = await load();\n      await hydrate();\n    },\n    { once: true }, // remove the event listener\n  );\n};\n\n\nmouseover.ts\nimport type { ClientDirective } from \"astro\";\n\n\nexport default (function (load, _opts, element) {\n  element.addEventListener(\n    \"mouseover\",\n    async () => {\n      const hydrate = await load();\n      await hydrate();\n    },\n  { once: true },\n);\n} satisfies ClientDirective);\n\n\n\nThis will hydrate the component once the mouseover event is triggered on the\nelement.\n\nThen add this directive as an Astro integration. Create a register.js or\nregister.ts file and add:\n\nregister.js\n/**\n * @type {() => import('astro').AstroIntegration}\n */\nexport default () => ({\n  name: \"client:mouseover\",\n  hooks: {\n    \"astro:config:setup\": ({ addClientDirective }) => {\n      addClientDirective({\n        name: \"mouseover\",\n        entrypoint: \"./src/lib/client-directives/mouseover.js\",\n      });\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nregister.ts\nimport type { AstroIntegration } from \"astro\";\n\n\nexport default (): AstroIntegration => ({\n  name: \"client:mouseover\",\n  hooks: {\n    \"astro:config:setup\": ({ addClientDirective }) => {\n      addClientDirective({\n        name: \"mouseover\",\n        entrypoint: \"./src/lib/client-directives/mouseover.ts\",\n      });\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nWe’ll also add types for the directive. Create an index.d.ts file and add:\n\nindex.d.ts\nimport \"astro\";\ndeclare module \"astro\" {\n  interface AstroClientDirectives {\n    \"client:mouseover\"?: boolean;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nFor WebStorm at least, this doesn’t seem to affect any of the types or warnings\nthat are picked up once you use a custom client directive, but it doesn’t hurt\nto add this anyway.\n\n\nBRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER\n\nFinally, we’ll add the client directive to our Astro config:\n\nastro.config.mjs\nimport mouseoverDirective from \"/src/lib/client-directives/register\";\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  integrations: [\n    mouseoverDirective(),\n    // ...\n  ],\n});\n\n\n\nWe can add it to any component like so:\n\n*.astro\n<ReactComponent client:mouseover />\n{/* You may get warnings about using it in your IDE (for example, that it requires a value in WebStorm), you could explicitly pass it a value of `true` (which doesn't affect anything but removes the warning) or just leave it. */}\n\n\nReactComponent.tsx\nimport { useEffect } from \"react\";\n\n\nexport function ReactComponent() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const content = document.querySelector(\"#content\");\n    if (content) content.textContent = \"Hydrated\";\n  }, []);\n\n\n  return <div id=\"content\">Hover over me</div>;\n}\n\n\n\nThen restart your development server for the client directive to be loaded.\n\nTo see if it’s working, open up your browser’s network tab, and check if this\ncomponent’s scripts are fetched once you hover over it.\n\nBrowser network tab showing component requests\n[/_astro/network-tab-requests.dNqvv6kG_ohqju.webp]\n\nYou may not ever need to use a custom client directive, but it’s a pretty cool\nfeature that highlights Astro’s flexibility."],[5,"PRELOADING IMAGES WITH ASTRO\n\nIt is fairly straightforward to preload images in an Astro site that are served\nfrom your public folder - you just need to get the path to the image, and add it\nto a link rel=\"preload\" tag:\n\n*.astro\n<head>\n  <link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/image.png\" as=\"image\" /> <!-- /public/image.png -->\n</head>\n\n\n\nBut how do you preload images that are loaded with the Image ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#image--astroassets] or Picture ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#picture-] components if you need\nthem to be optimized? There’s no simple way to do this, like with Next.js’s\nImage priority feature ↗\n[https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#priority].\n\nBut you can use Astro’s getImage ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#generating-images-with-getimage]\nfunction to generate an optimized image server-side (or during the build for\nstatic sites), and use this image’s path in the preload’s href and on the page\n(as an <img> or picture>) instead.\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nIn this example, we’ll preload an image from our /src/assets folder called\nproject.png.\n\nStart by importing the getImage function and the image in an Astro page or\ncomponent:\n\n*.astro\n---\nimport { getImage } from \"astro:assets\";\n\n\nimport image from \"../assets/project.png\".\nconst optimizedImage = await getImage({\n  src: image,\n  format: \"webp\",\n  width: 500, // resize optional\n  height: 500, // resize optional\n});\n---\n\n\n\nTo use this optimized image, you can still use the <Image /> component:\n\n<Image\n  src={optimizedImage.options.src}\n  width={optimizedImage.attributes.width}\n  height={optimizedImage.attributes.height}\n  alt=\"\"\n/>\n\n\n\nYou can also use a normal <img> tag:\n\n<img\n  src={optimizedImage.src}\n  width={optimizedImage.attributes.width}\n  height={optimizedImage.attributes.height}\n  alt=\"\"\n/>\n\n\n\nFinally, add a preload with the image to your page’s head element:\n\n*.astro\n<head>\n  <link rel=\"preload\" href={optimizedImage.src} as=\"image\" />\n</head>\n\n\n\nIf you’re using a layout with an existing <head>, then you can use named slots ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#named-slots] to\npass in the link tag from another page or component without creating duplicate\n<head> tags:\n\nLayout.astro\n<head>\n  {/* ... */}\n\n\n  <slot name=\"head\" />\n</head>\n\n\n*.astro\n<Fragment slot=\"head\">\n  <link rel=\"preload\" href={optimizedImage.src} as=\"image\" />\n</Fragment>\n\n\n\n\nCONTENT COLLECTIONS\n\nIf you’re using content collections, and you’re including images in the\ncollection schema ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#images-in-content-collections], then\nyou can reference this image directly:\n\n[slug].astro\n---\nimport { getImage } from \"astro:assets\";\n\n\n/* export async function getStaticPaths() { ... }, etc. */\n\n\nconst { project } = Astro.props;\nconst optimizedImage = await getImage({ src: project.data.image });\n---\n\n\n\n\nBRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER\n\nTo check that the preloading worked correctly, you can build your site and run\nit locally - change the commands as needed based on your package manager.\n\nFor static sites, run npm run build and then npm run preview.\n\nFor hybrid or server sites, you should be able to use the Node.js adapter ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/] (even if you’re\nusing another adapter like for Vercel or Netlify, just swap them out for\ntesting). Run npm run build and then npm run preview.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be a simple built-in way of checking preloaded resources.\nBut if you open your browser’s network tab and filter for images, the preloaded\nimage should be at or near the top of all requests:\n\nbrowser network tab showing image resources\n[/_astro/browser-network-tab.pSumB9v3_1d2Kh5.webp]\n\nYou can also remove the filter to see how it compares with all other request\ntypes, or re-build with the preload removed to see how it changes.\n\nMake sure to also check the page source - the paths in the <link> tag and <img>\ntag should match:\n\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/_astro/project.xCZHVmaS_29nlmI.webp\" as=\"image\">\n\n\n<img src=\"/_astro/project.xCZHVmaS_29nlmI.webp\" />\n\n\n\nAlso, if you’re using Chrome or Edge, you’ll get a warning in your console after\na few seconds if it didn’t work - The resource *.webp was preloaded using link\npreload but not used within a few seconds .... Other browsers may do something\nsimilar.\n\n\nVIEW TRANSITIONS\n\nIf you’re using View Transitions ↗\n[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/] and animations between\nimages, preloading should also help prevent the image flickering as it’s loaded\nfor the first time as you navigate to the new page.\n\nFor example, if you have a product carousel with small images linking to product\npages with a larger resolution of the same image, you may want to preload these\nlarger images.\n\nOtherwise, it can look jarring when the image loads during the element’s\ntransition to the next page. Preloading the image should help with this.\nAlternatively, you could use the same image between pages if you’re willing to\nsacrifice flexibility with the optimizations e.g. width and height.\n\nKeep in mind that preloading isn’t a guarantee for improving things, and may\nactually make your page performance worse. But the example in this post is a\nreasonable solution if you feel the need to use preloading or other optimization\ntechniques."],[6,"THIRD-PARTY AUTHENTICATION WITH SURREALDB\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis tutorial will cover how to authenticate using a third-party provider with\nSurrealDB ↗ [https://surrealdb.com/].

If there’s a better way of doing things, let me know.\n\n\nPOSTS TABLE\n\nRunning this query will:\n\n * set permissions - posts can only be changed by their user\n * define table fields\n * create a users relation\n\nDEFINE TABLE posts SCHEMAFULL\n  PERMISSIONS\n    FOR create, update, delete WHERE users = $auth.id;\n\n\nDEFINE FIELD content on posts TYPE string;\nDEFINE FIELD users ON posts TYPE record (users) ASSERT $value IS NOT NONE;\n\n\n\n\nAPP SETUP\n\n\nSETTING UP GOOGLE AUTHENTICATION\n\nIn your env.local file, add these variables (changing any values as required):\n\nTerminal window\nNEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000\nNEXTAUTH_SECRET=yoursecret\nSURREAL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000\nSURREAL_NAMESPACE=test\nSURREAL_DATABASE=test\nSURREAL_USERNAME=root\nSURREAL_PASSWORD=root\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=yourclientid\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=yourclientsecret\n\n\n\nInstall the SurrealDB SDK ↗\n[https://surrealdb.com/docs/integration/sdks/javascript]:\n\nTerminal window\nnpm install surrealdb.js\n\n\n\nCreate a surrealdb.ts file in a lib (or similar) folder and add:\n\nimport { Surreal } from \"surrealdb.js\";\n\n\nconst connectionString = process.env.SURREAL_ENDPOINT!;\nconst namespace = process.env.SURREAL_NAMESPACE!;\nconst database = process.env.SURREAL_DATABASE!;\nconst username = process.env.SURREAL_USERNAME!;\nconst password = process.env.SURREAL_PASSWORD!;\n\n\nconst db = new Surreal();\n\n\ndb.connect(`${connectionString}/rpc`, {\n   namespace,\n   database,\n   auth: { username, password },\n});\n\n\nexport { db };\n\n\n\nWe will import this SurrealDB client whenever we need to use our database.\n\nOpen api/auth/[...nextauth].ts and add the code for Google:\n\nimport NextAuth, { type NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth'\n\n\nimport GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google'\nimport { db } from '@/lib/db'\n\n\nexport const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {\n   adapter: SurrealDBAdapter(clientPromise),\n   providers: [\n      GoogleProvider({\n         clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID!,\n         clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET!\n      })\n   ],\n   session: { strategy: 'jwt' },\n   callbacks: {\n      async jwt({ token, account, profile }) {\n\n\n         if (profile) {\n\n\n            token.googleSub = profile.sub\n\n\n            try {\n               await db.signin({\n                  namespace,\n                  database,\n                  scope: 'users',\n                  sub: profile.sub,\n                  email: token.email\n               })\n            } catch {\n               // otherwise sign up\n               await db.signup({\n                  namespace,\n                  database,\n                  scope: 'users',\n                  sub: profile.sub,\n                  name: token.name,\n                  email: token.email,\n                  picture: token.picture\n               })\n            }\n\n\n         }\n\n\n         return token\n      }\n   }\n}\n\n\nexport default NextAuth(authOptions)\n\n\n\n\nOPTIONAL\n\nAuth.js has a SurrealDB adapter ↗\n[https://authjs.dev/reference/adapter/surrealdb] - using this will create a new\nrecord in the account and user tables for every sign-in as a part of their\ndatabase model ↗ [https://authjs.dev/getting-started/adapters#models]. This is\noptional as we’re not using this data or any of the helper functions this\nadapter provides.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn the future, there will likely be official integrations or code available to\nmake third-party authentication easier.\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions or questions, or if there’s anything\nmissing or incorrect."]],"type":"string"}},"enabled":true,"isSorted":true},"language":"english"}
